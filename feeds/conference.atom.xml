&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the efforts of Ivan and Mr Gi, along with the support of the Ministry of
Education Singapore, the first EDU Summit was successfully held on the first
day of the conference. The summit brought together Computing and Computer
Science educators from O-levels to tertiary institutions to share their
teaching experiences and upcoming changes to the computing curriculum for O and
A levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be updating this blog post with links to slide decks once we receive
them from the speakers. Keep a lookout for them either via this blog post or
our Twitter account. Our friends from engineers.sg have also recorded videos of
talks during this conference and these videos will also be viewable online once
they are available.&lt;/p&gt;
