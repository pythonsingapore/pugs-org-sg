For the second year in a row, Shopee invited the Python User Group to an open 
house event where some of Shopee's engineers would share about their work at 
Shopee.

The event was a great success. RSVP was maxed out after a few minutes and indeed
more than 120 people showed up for the talks. Shopee provided pizza and
soft drinks and a great spacious auditorium at their office.

We will share the slides here, soon...
