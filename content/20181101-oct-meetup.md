We couldn't find a good day in the last week of October, so our October 2018 Meetup actually took place on November 1st ;)

## Talk 1: "Performance Improvements with Cython" by Kaivalya Rawal

Programming languages have various technical variations: compiled vs interpreted, statically typed vs dynamically typed, object-oriented vs functional, and so on. However, languages also vary by speed of execution, learning curves, syntax rules, and ease of use. Python does very well on the latter three accounts, and has thus seen spectacular growth in popularity. However execution speed, especially relative to lower level languages, often leaves something more to be desired. In this talk, we'll explore how to bridge this divide using static typing to improve speed, while retaining all the goodness and familiarity of Python.

Kaivalya is a computer science undergraduate from India, currently working as a research assistant at NTU. He spent the summer learning and optimising PracMLN - an open source Markov Logic Networks library, using Cython. His work has currently taken him into data modeling and network analysis, but he loves all things Python.
