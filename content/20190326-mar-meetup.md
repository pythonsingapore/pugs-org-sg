58 attendees gathered at the Zendesk office and were surprised by once again
unusual but awesome food choices. Of course, our speakers were great, too:

The second talk was a hands-on demonstration about simple IoT applications using
Raspberry Pi by Ang Swee Chye. This demonstration did not use any slides.
