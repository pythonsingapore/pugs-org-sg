## Agenda

**7pm: Meet & Greet**

**7:30pm: How being a sore loser at board games helped an amateur coder write
his first 1,000 line project by Yi Sheng Siow**

Asymmetric board games, where players play different roles and game actions, are
getting more popular, but it's not easy to balance such games. Amateur
programmer and sore loser Yi Sheng shared how he scripted the rules and game
flow of board game Not Alone
(https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/194879/not-alone) in Python and made Python
objects play against each other thousands of times to validate his suspicions
that the game is unfair for one side. He then expanded his program to attempt to
find and test winning strategies in the game.

Siow Yi Sheng had a life of wealth management and financial audit before
focusing his efforts on his love of programming. He is currently doing projects
in web development, software engineering, data science, web scraping to build
his portfolio and enter the industry.

**8:00pm: Comparing building command line tools with argparse, docopt and click
by Saurabh Hirani**

Saurabh went through sample use cases of building a common command line tool
with argparse, docopt and click (in that order of complexity) and call out
situations in which each library works best.

**8:30pm: Switching between terminal logs and json logs by Saurabh Hirani**

In a lightning talk, Saurabh presented how to leverage the Python logging
library - jsonlogger and structlog to switch between terminal and json logs -
optimizing for user readability and output parseability.

Saurabh is currently working at Autodesk Singapore as a Senior DevOps engineer
and loves to automate infrastructure and build tools.
