## Agenda

This month, Shopee Singapore would like to invite the local Python community to
an open house event at the Shopee Cafeteria.

We will feature a panel discussion with engineers from different teams at Shopee
(data science, data engineering, regional operations). Each of them will give a
short talk about how they use Python (with code examples) and the audience is
encouraged to post questions so that an engaging panel discussion ensues.

The topics aren't set in stone, but to give you an idea of how Shopee uses
Python, here are some of the topics that could be covered:

### REGIONAL OPERATIONS

* Using Python Pandas packages to detect duplicated listings on the platform
* Using Python to generate reports for different countries to facilitate their daily work

### DATA ENGINEERING

* Data Visualization with Python and Apache Superset
* What role does Python play in Superset
* Facts & Figures: Dashboards at Shopee (with some live data)

### DATA SCIENCE

Showcase of some Python packages heavily used in the area of data science, such as

* Virtualenv
* Jupyter
* Pandas
