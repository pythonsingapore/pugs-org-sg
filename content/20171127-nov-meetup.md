## Agenda

**7pm: Meet & Greet**

**7:30pm: Introduction to Type Hints by Björn Andersson**

Björn has recently learned about Type Hints (see
<https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/>) and discovered that they can be of
tremendous help when refactoring large code-bases. He will show us how you can
make use of them today, by integrating them into your IDE and gradually
including them into your codebase, one module at a time.

**8:00pm: Pipenv, in Brief by Nicholas WL Koh**

Pipenv is a packaging tool that brings concepts from other bundlers (e.g. npm)
to the Python world. We'll walk through a simple workflow, contrasting it with
Virtualenvwrapper.

Nick wishes he took CS instead of Business classes back in his University days
(which weren't too long ago). He is currently building tools for the events
industry, such as www.wedever.co.
