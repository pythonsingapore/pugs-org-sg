<p>On behalf of all the PyCon organizing committee members, I would like to thank
everyone for their support for PyCon Singapore 2015 which was held
at <a href="http://www.sp.edu.sg/">Singapore Polytechnic</a> from 17th June to 19th June.</p>
<p>This marks the 6th conference to be organized by the Python User Group
Community in Singapore and we hope that your feedback and support will help us
improve and take the conference to the next level in the coming years. A short
<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1NOurBthP6AeRhYq2xH9uOirGAaQPH6tNvRJoISnZkXU/viewform?c=0&amp;w=1">feedback form</a>
is available online which will not take you more than five minutes
to complete.</p>
<p>Thanks to the efforts of Ivan and Mr Gi, along with the support of the Ministry of
Education Singapore, the first EDU Summit was successfully held on the first
day of the conference. The summit brought together Computing and Computer
Science educators from O-levels to tertiary institutions to share their
teaching experiences and upcoming changes to the computing curriculum for O and
A levels.</p>
<p>We will be updating this blog post with links to slide decks once we receive
them from the speakers. Keep a lookout for them either via this blog post or
our Twitter account. Our friends from engineers.sg have also recorded videos of
talks during this conference and these videos will also be viewable online once
they are available.</p>
<p>PyCon SG 2015 would not have been possible without the tremendous support we
have received from our sponsors and volunteers. I would like to thank our
sponsors, <a href="http://www.sp.edu.sg">Singapore Polytechnic</a>,
<a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/">Braintree</a>,
<a href="http://neo.com">Neo</a>,
<a href="https://bitmazk.com">Bitmazk</a>,
<a href="https://carousell.com">Carousell</a>,
<a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com">ThoughtWorks</a>,
<a href="https://www.python.org/psf/">Python Software Foundation</a>
and <a href="http://mysql.com">MySQL</a> for supporting the community and making this
conference possible. Student helpers and their teacher, Mr Gi, from
<a href="http://www.dhs.sg/">Dunman High School</a> played a huge role in ensuring that
the conference ran smoothly. Special thanks go out to our keynote speakers
Andrew Godwin, Jessica McKellar and Lynn Root for their inspirational keynotes.</p>
<p>Last but not least, as the chair of this conference, I would like to thank the
organizing committee for all their hard work in the past year to make this
conference a reality. We will soon be opening a call for volunteers for
PyCon SG 2016; if you are interested in helping out with the conference (no
technical chops required), look out for our next meeting!</p>
<p>Sincerely, Victor Neo</p>
<p>Chairman, PyCon Singapore 2015</p>
